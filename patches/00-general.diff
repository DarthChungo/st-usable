+# st-usable
+My personal build of the Simple Terminal (St) with many patches included.
+Currently targets st version `0.9`.
+The working directory directory already includes all patches, although all individual patch files can be found in the `patches/` directory if you wish to use them separately.
+Keep in mind that patch files have been modified to work together, so removing some of them will likely mean some rewriting.
+
+## Included patches
+- alpha
+- boxdraw
+- scrollback _(with reflow, mouse & altscreen sub-patches)_
+- ligatures _(modified to be compatible with both alpha, scrollback & boxdraw)_
+
+## Installation
+Simply use:
+
+```bash
+git clone git@github.com:DarthChungo/st-usable.git
+cd st-usable
+sudo make install
+xrdb merge ~/.Xresources
+```
